# ALK_final_project

### Project goal

In the evolving world of personalized medicine, the use of complete and extensive genetic data is playing an increasingly important role. The analysis and understanding of cancer genetics allows for the identification of new mutations and complex genomic features, allowing for more accurate patient stratification in terms of targeted therapies, identification of resistance biomarkers and prediction of further risk.

The project aims to discover genomic features extracted from whole genome sequencing (WGS) data to identify patients likely to respond to PARP inhibitors (PARPi).


### Biological explanation:


### Methodology

Clinical metadata and raw data from whole-genome sequencing of patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer were downloaded from 3 publicly available repositories collecting genomic and clinical data from oncology patients. A total of 255 samples were collected, for which the original IDs were anonymized.

#### Genomic data processing:

#### Clinical metadata processing:
